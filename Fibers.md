# Fibers

## Natural vs Man-Made

Natural fibers consist of anything that is made from a plant, i.e. cotton, bamboo, or jute; or derived from animals, i.e. wool, alpaca, camel hair, or silk.
Man-made fibers are largely oil-based, i.e. polyester, nylon, or spandex.

## Staple vs Filament

Staple fibers are short fibers, such as cotton, that are amassed and twisted into yarns. Filament fibers are made from one long strand that is kept intact, i.e. silk.

Blends are usually formed by wrapping a filament fiber with a staple fiber, creating a blend of the strength of the filament fiber and the texture of the staple fiber.
