Located on the Korean peninsula to the east of [[China]], Korea has consisted of two separate countries since the [[Korean War]] in 1950-1953. These two countries, [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]] couldn’t be more different, with the South being considered [[Democracy|democratic]] and aligned more with the west, while North Korea is a [[Communism|communist]] [[Dictator|dictatorship]].

Before [[World War II]], Korea had been occupied by [[Japan]] (See: [[Japanese Occupation of Korea]]) since 1910. The two countries have had a lot of animosity between them before and since. This period was marked by an all out war on Korean culture by the Japanese, trying to erase their [[Korean Language|language]], their [[Hangeul|system of writing]], and many of the things that made them “Korean.” Before this period, the [[Empire of Korea]] had been established by the [[Joseon Dynasty]]
