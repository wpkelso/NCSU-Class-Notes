# Tree

An undirected, [[Cycle|acyclic]] [[Graph|graph]] in which any two [[Vertex|vertices]] are connected by exactly one [[Edge|edge]]. In tree terminology, edges are referred to as branches, and end vertexes are referred to as leaves.

## Rooted Trees

Once a certain vertex on a tree is designated as the “root”, all other vertices can then be described in relation to each other and to the root.
