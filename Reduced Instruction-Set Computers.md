#computer_architecture 
Computers with a reduced [[Instruction Set Architecture]], set of registers, & addressing modes available. In a RISC architecture, [[Arithmetic Instructions|arithmetic operations]]can only access registers, and only [[Memory Instructions|memory instructions]] can access memory. [[Control Flow Instructions]] use PC-relative addressing.

*Ex.* MIPS, RISC-5
