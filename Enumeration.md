# Enumeration

An enumeration of a [[Set|set]] $A\neq 0$ is any surjective [[Function|function]] $f:\mathbb{Z}^{+} \to A$. Defined less formally, an enumeration is simply a (possibly infinite) list of elements of $A$ such that every element of $A$ appears on the list at some finite position.

This definition implies naturally that if $A$ has an enumeration, then it is [[Set Countability|countable]].

## Further Implications of the Definition

1. Different enumerations of the same set in which the order in which the elements appear differ can exist.
2. Redundant enumerations are still enumerations.
3. Enumerations must have a beginning (ex. cannot be defined as $\dots, 3, 2, 1$).
