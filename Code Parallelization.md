Typically, there are 4 major steps to any parellelization scheme:

1. Decomposition: dividing the program into parallel tasks
2. Assignment: assigning tasks to the parallel processes
3. Communication: sync between the different processes
4. Mapping: mapping processes into hardware processing elements
