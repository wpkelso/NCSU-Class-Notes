In mathematics, a tuple refers to an ordered [[Set|set]] of $n$ elements. It is an extension of the definition of an ordered pair, and as both are defined under the same definition for ease of writing.

>[!note] Definition
>$$\langle x,y \rangle=\{ \{ x \},\{ x, y \} \}$$
>This definition is considered valid due to the definition of the reverse ordered pair, where $$\langle y, x \rangle \neq \{ \{ y \}, \{ x, y \} \}$$, being different than the initial definition.
