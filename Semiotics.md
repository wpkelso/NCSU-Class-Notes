# Semiotics

Semiotics is the theory of signs and their relationships to what they represent and how they are interpreted by a viewer.

> [!note] Signs & Referents
> A _sign_ is something that represents a thing or idea, while it’s _referent_ is the thing that is being represented.

> **Types of Signs**
>
> -   **Icon:** image that _resembles_ it’s referent
> -   **Index:** image that _points to_ it’s referent
> -   **Symbol:** a sign with no natural connection to it’s referent, being _arbitrarily assigned_

## Types of Meaning

Within semiotics, there are two types of meaning considered, denotative and connotative meaning.

**Denotative meaning** is something that has a _literal connection_, such as an icon. **Connotative** meaning is something that has a _connection by association_,
