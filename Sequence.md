# Sequence

## Mathematics

In mathematics, a sequence is defined as a  [[Function|function]] , whose domain is a [[Set|set]] that is both [[Set Countability|countable]] and totally ordered. In simpler terms, it is a list of elements with a particular order.

### Types of Sequences

- [[Arithmetic Sequence|Arithmetic Sequences]]
- [[Geometric Sequence|Geometric Sequences]]

## Embedded Computing

Sequencing involves controlling an output through a series of steps, performed on after the other.

*Ex.
- *How to make ice:
	- *Fill the ice tray with water
	- *Chill the ice tray until the water is frozen
	- *Heat the ice tray to allow the ice to separate from the tray
	- *Eject the ice from the tray
