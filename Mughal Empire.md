# Mughal Empire

An empire that occupied most of the [[India|Indian subcontinent]] prior to the conquest by the [[British East India Company|British East India Company]]. Up until the takeover by the English, it was one of the most powerful empires to ever exist in the region.

Along with the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Safavid Empire]], it was considered one of the “Gunpowder Empires”, so called because they utilized comparatively new technologies to achieve their regional power.

## Consolidation

The Mughals originally came from central Asia during the beginning of the 16th century, and established a region of control that really solidified itself during the reign of Emperor Akbar (r. 1556-1605).

The bureaucracy established during this period, particularly with regards to revenue and taxes, laid the groundwork for the eventually take-over by the [[British East India Company]] 

In particular, Akbar undertook large land surveys and monetized tax collection on the basis of the standard silver rupee.

## Cultural Universalism

One of the core tenants of the Mughal empire was the creation of the idea of a Mughal culture that took elements from all of the cultures that they ruled over. They often sponsored translations of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] texts to Persian, as well as many other parts of both Hinduism and [[Islam]].

## Trade Importance

By the 17th & 18th century, [[India]] was the world’s largest exporter of cotton textiles. This in turn brought in the English via the [[British East India Company|British East India Company’s]] establishment of key trading bases (Bombay, Madras, Calcutta) along the coast of India. All of these cities eventually became major commercial cities in the region.

## Mughal Disintegration

Following 1707 and the death of the last “Great Mughal Emperor”, the empire started to disintegrate, becoming only a minor player in the region over the course of the 18th century.
