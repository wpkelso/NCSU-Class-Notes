# Digital Logic

Digital logic is a binary system, mapping regions of high and low voltage in the output of a CMOS [[[Field Effect Transistor|FET]] to digital values of `1` and `0` respectively.

## Logic Levels

In the ideal world, there are only two voltage levels defined for the digital logic levels: 

$$\begin{cases} \\
V_{L} & \text{when the logic level is `low`} \\
V_{H} & \text{when the logic level is `high`}
\end{cases}$$ \\
 V_{L} \text{when the logic level is ‘’`low`}
