A [[Determinant|determinant]] often used in the study of [[Differential Equation|differential equations]], often used to show [[Linear Independence|linear independence]] in a set of solutions.

## Showing Linear Independence
If the Wronskian is not equal to zero, then it shows that the two values are [[Linear Independence|linearly independent]].

## Wronskian for Vectors
$$W(\vec{x_{1}},
\vec{x_{2}}) = \det{\lbrack\vec{x_{1}}
}{\vec{x_{2}}\rbrack}$$
