Embedded systems often work with peripheral hardware in conjunction with software to achieve [[Task (OS)|tasks (OS)]]. These peripherals will allow for actions such as timing, interrupts, or conversion between digital and analog signals.

## Examples of Common Peripheral Hardware
- [[Digital-to-Analog Converters]]
- [[Analog-to-Digital Converters]]
- [[Timers (Embedded Systems)]]
- [[Direct Memory Address Unit]]
- [[Serial Communications Units]]
