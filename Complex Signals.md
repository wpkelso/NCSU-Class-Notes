Real world [[Signal]] cannot be complex, but complex signals can be defined within the [[Complex Domain|complex domain]]
- Many connections between complex signals, [[Maxwell's Equations]], [[Phasors]], etc.

>[!note] Formula
$x(t)=\text{Re}(x(t))+j\text{Im}(x(t))$
*Complex signals have a real part "Re" and an [[Imaginary Numbers|imaginary]] part, "Im"*
