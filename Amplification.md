# Amplification

Amplification is a method by which the magnitude of a [[Signal|signal]] is increased, increasing the time-varying voltage or current. The output signal of an amplifier is proportional to the input signal, with the **gain** of the amplifier expressed logarithmically in terms of decibels (dB). In simplest terms, the output signal is a [[Sinusoidal Function|sinusoidal signal]] with the same frequency as the input signal but a proportionally different amplitude and phase.

>[!summary] Equations
>Amplified output power: $P_{0}=\left( \frac{V_{0}}{\sqrt{ 2 }} \right)^{2} \frac{1}{R_{L}}, \;\therefore V_{0}=\sqrt{ 2P_{0} R_{L}}$
>
>Amplified output current: $i_{O}=I_{o} (\sin \omega_{s}t+\theta)$
>
>Input current: $I_{s}= \frac{V_{s}}{R_{i}+R_{in}}$, $I_{o}=\frac{V_{o}}{R_{L}}$

> Gain is always given as the output current/voltage over the input current/voltage.
