# British East India Company

Formed in the early 17th century under King James I to establish trading connections with [[India]]. Their first major territorial expansions occurred during the [[Seven Years War]] in (1756-63).

## Sepoys

Hired soldiers/mercenaries from India that were employed by the East India Company as a means of converting trade money to military power. Originally, this strategy was employed by the French East India Company, but grew out of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] practices.

In this specific model, the armies were administered and officer-ed by Europeans, but were soldiered by Indians.
