## Notable Darbars

### Delhi Darbar of 1911

This marked the coronation of King George V, as well as the only time that a British monarch ever actually went to [[India]]. At this event, the King announced that the partition of [[Bengal]] would be undone, as well as the movement of the capital from Calcutta to Delhi, a move that symbolized the British appeal to the “old tradition of [[Mughal Empire]] in India.”
