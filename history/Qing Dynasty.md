# Qing Dynasty

**Preceded by** â†’ [[Ming Dynasty]]

Existing from 1636CE-1911CE as the last of the great Chinese dynasties that existed. Founded by the Manchus, a people from far north China near [[Korea]], with the seizure of Beijing. The Qing dynasty saw a massive campaign to expand the geographical scope of the empire, partly as a way of removing all Ming sympathizers they could find, in particular adding Taiwan and Xinjiang to their territorial holdings.
