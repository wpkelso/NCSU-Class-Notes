# Crown Rule

A system of rule implemented in [[India]] between 1857 and 1947 based on a hierarchical administration with racially defined British elite on top and large numbers of low-level Indian officials below them.

There existed a large administration for revenue collection based on the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] models, with much expanded record-keeping and recognition of private property. Within this model, the heaviest government spending was on the military.

> The British saw themselves as bringers of “modernity” to India, but in practice sought to free the social structure in the interest of stability by maintaining the power of traditional landed elites and high caste leaders.

## Imperial Darbars

Derived from the name for the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Court]], these were staged (in a “[[Mediæval]]” style) festivals meant to evoke an imagined past for India. In it, princes would come to pledge their allegiance to the viceroy among other activities.

## Ideology of the Rule of Law

The law was projected as a vision of “Modernity and rationality” by the Crown, lording over a “Traditional” India.

### Criminal & Property Law

The British generally reformed criminal and property law to support British Imperial control and economic extraction.

### Personal Law

Personal law was organized to maintain and strengthen “Traditional” caste, religious, and family organization in Indian society. [[Hinduism|Hindu]] law and [[Islam|Muslim]] law were linked to their respective indigenous texts, and then systematized to be applied by the British courts. This produced systems that became known as “Anglo-Hindu Law” and “Anglo-Muhammadan Law”.

## Growth of the “Middle Class”

Indian lawyers, journalists, professionals, English-educated elites were an important part of the apparatus of British rule, but a relatively small minority of the population. However, they were still prevented by racial barriers from attaining real positions of power.

These educated elites eventually formed a “Public” that challenged the exclusionary British policies, but also criticized Indian society and worked for reform. Some of their earliest critiques were on the colonial economy focused on agricultural exports to more advanced British industrial economy. Following these critiques, the Viceroy tried to marginalize the [[Indian National Congress]] that had developed by calling it  a “microscopic minority.”
