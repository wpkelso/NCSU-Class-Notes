# Crown Rule

A system of rule implemented in [[India]] between 1857 and 1947 based on a hierarchical administration with racially defined British elite on top and large numbers of low-level Indian officials below them.

There existed a large administration for revenue collection based on the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] models, with much expanded record-keeping and recognition of private property. Within this model, the heaviest government spending was on the military.

> The British saw themselves as bringers of “modernity” to India, but in practice sought to free the social structure in the interest of stability by maintaining the power of traditional landed elites and high caste leaders.
