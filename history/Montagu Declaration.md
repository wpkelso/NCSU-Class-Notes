# Montagu Declaration (1917)

A declaration by the viceroy at the time that promised an eventual preparation for “Self-Government” of India, but provided no timeline for this to happen. Additionally, following [[World War I]] there were multiple reforms in the structure of rule.

In 1919, the follow-up Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms transferred greater powers to Indians at the provincial level (not at the central level).
