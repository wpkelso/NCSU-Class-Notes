# Canton (Guangzhou) System

[[Qing Dynasty|Qing Empire]]-era system in which all foreign merchants were confined to trading only through the port of Guangzhou if they wanted to trade with China. A group of internal Chinese merchants called the Hong Merchants were then allowed to act as a middle-man and liaison between those European merchants and the rest of the country.
