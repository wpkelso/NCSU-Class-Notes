# British East India Company

Formed in the early 17th century under King James I to establish trading connections with [[India]]. Their first major territorial expansions occurred during the [[Seven Years War]] in (1756-63).

## Company Armies

The company developed armies based primarily around Indian mercenaries called [[Sepoy|sepoys]] for the common soldier. It used these for protection, and then eventually conquering and taking over territory. Originally, this strategy was employed by the French East India Company, but grew out of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] practices.

In this specific model, the armies were administered and officer-ed by Europeans, but were soldiered by Indians.
