# Indian National Congress

A group of [[Crown Rule#Growth of the “Middle Class”|Indian elite and middle class]] that came together to form a _public_ that critiqued British rule. Eventually, they would incite protests and revolts against [[Crown Rule]] in India.

## Major Protest Movements

> [!note]
> The 1868 protest centered on “Swadeshi”, which was a focus on Indian made goods. Effectively, it was an economic boycott of British goods.

The images and ideas associated with this movement led to the founding of the [[Muslim League]] in 1906 due to friction between Hindu and Muslim parts of the movement. This movement also led to internal divisions in the Congress over the dangers inherent to popular mobilization.

The British worked to accentuate the divisions in the Congress through the Indian Councils Act of 1909, which allowed Limited Elected Indian Representation on British advisory councils, which includes “Separate Electorates” for Muslims. They also arrested some of the more “extreme” members of the congress, tried them for sedition, and sent them to a penal colony in the Andaman Islands.
