# Art Nouveau

Art Nouveau was a philosophical and [[Style|stylistic]] movement that emerged in that late 19th century, circa 1890, particularly in Europe. It focused on breaking down the barriers between the “Fine” arts and the “Applied” arts in everything (even the mundane), with the idea that “art and design should be a way of life.” It’s primary flourishing was between 1890 and 1905 in Europe, then held on for many years in various artistic outposts.

## A Reaction to Historicism

Art Nouveau exists as a reaction to the [[Historicism]] that characterized the [[Style|style]] of the [[Industrial Revolution]], and was showcased at the [[Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace]]. It represented growth, changed, and movement as it’s unifying ideas, perfect for the new millennium.

## Characteristics and Forms

- Linear dominance
- Patterning of areas
- Flattening of space
- Play of positive/negative [[Shape|shapes]]
- Distortion of nature for expression
- Harmony of all elements

There were two major forms within Art Nouveau, which were called different things in different places:

1. **Floral & curvilinear**
    - Art Nouveau (England, France, Belgium)
    - Jugendstil/“Youth style” (Germany)
    - Stile Liberty (Italy)
    - Tiffany (United States)
1. Geometric & rectilinear
    - Secession (Austria)
    - Mackintosh (Scotland)

## Influences

The forms of Art Nouveau can be traced to [[Celtic]] and [[Mediæval]] art, as well as [[Rococo]] forms of the 18th century. Further influences include [[Japanese Art]], and other “exotic art” from non-western cultures.

## Social Effects

Some artists within the movement sought to speak to the same social issues as the [[Arts & Crafts Movement]], creating an alternative to the soulless mechanization of the Industrial movement (and the [[Communism|Bourgeoisie]]). These ideas eventually coalesced into the [[Bohemian Movement]] and lifestyle, that eventually connected with the anti-establishment movements of the 1960s.
