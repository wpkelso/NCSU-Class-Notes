# Art Nouveau

Art Nouveau was a philosophical and [[Style|stylistic]] movement that emerged in that late 19th century, circa 1890, particularly in Europe. It focused on breaking down the barriers between the “Fine” arts and the “Applied” arts in everything (even the mundane), with the idea that “art and design should be a way of life.”
