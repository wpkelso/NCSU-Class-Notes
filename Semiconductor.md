A material that can act as both an insulator or a conductor based on various properties such as applied energy or material temperature.

# Origin of Properties
The properties of semiconductors show their most prevalence in high-purity, single-crystal materials, which are formed by the [[Covalent Bond|covalent bonding]] of atoms (of in this case Silicon) with their nearest neighbors. At 0 Kelvin, all of these bonds within the lattice are complete. However, as the temperature rises, some of those bonds break and electrons are freed for conductivity. These broken bonds create gaps, referred to as **electron-hole pairs**.

>[!note] Definition
>**Band-Gap Energy:** the minimum energy required to break a covalent bond in a semiconductor material.
>**Intrinsic Carrier Concentration:** the density of free electrons in a semiconductor is given by temperature and material properties and is always the same for a given material at a given temperature.
>**Drift Current:** the current resulting from the movement/drifting of charged particles in response to an applied electric field.
>**Mobility:** the constant of proportionality between the carrier drift velocity and the electric field.

# Doping
Impurity doping, or just doping, is the practice of purposefully introducing impurities to the semiconductor material in minute and precise amounts to better control the resistivity of the resulting ‘doped semiconductor’.

## Donor Impurities
In silicon, donor impurities are from column V, with the most commonly used elements being phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony. At room temperature, these donor atoms have one free electron in their [[Valance Shell|valance shell]] that can be given up for conduction.

## Acceptor Impurities
In silicon, acceptor impurities are from column III, with the primary impurity in use being boron. At room temperature, these impurities create a hole in the lattice, allowing another electron to move into it thereby creating another hole elsewhere.

## Electron & Hole Concentrations
The consequences of doping semiconductor materials is that the concentrations of electrons and holes are no longer equal. From this two new definitions arise based on the carrier concentrations:
- $n>p$ n-type
- $p>n$ p-type
Where $n$ is the electron concentration and $p$ is the hole concentration. An importance of keeping track of these concentrations is that semiconductor materials **must remain charge neutral.**

# Total Current within Semiconductors
As mentioned earlier, electron drift currents are present within semiconductors. However, these aren’t the only currents present within a semiconductor. A second current flow mechanism called **diffusion current** is present, where free carriers tend to move from areas of high doping concentration to areas of low doping concentration.

Given this, it naturally follows that the total current present within a semiconductor is equivalent to the sum of the corresponding drift and diffusion components.
