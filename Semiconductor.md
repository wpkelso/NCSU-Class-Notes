A material that can act as both an insulator or a conductor based on various properties such as applied energy or material temperature.

# Origin of Properties
The properties of semiconductors show their most prevalence in high-purity, single-crystal materials, which are formed by the [[Covalent Bond|covalent bonding]] of atoms (of in this case Silicon) with their nearest neighbors. At 0 Kelvin, all of these bonds within the lattice are complete. However, as the temperature rises, some of those bonds break and electrons are freed for conductivity. These broken bonds create gaps, referred to as **electron-hole pairs**.

>[!note] Definition
>**Band-Gap Energy:** the minimum energy required to break a covalent bond in a semiconductor material.
>**Intrinsic Carrier Concentration:** the density of free electrons in a semiconductor is given by temperature and material properties and is always the same for a given material at a given temperature.
>**Drift Current:** the current resulting from the movement/drifting of charged particles in response to an applied electric field.
>**Mobility:** the constant of proportionality between the carrier drift velocity and the electric field.
