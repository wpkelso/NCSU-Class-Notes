>$$N(x,y)\frac{dy}{dx}+M(x,y)=0$$
>Where $N,M$ are two functions of $x,y$

## Method of Discovery
To find whether an equation is an exact equation, 
1. Write the equation in the form as above
2. Multiply by $dx$
3. Take a [[Partial Derivative|partial derivative]] with respect to $x$ of N
4. Take a partial derivative with respect to $y$ of M
5. If the two sides don't match, the equation isn't an exact equation
