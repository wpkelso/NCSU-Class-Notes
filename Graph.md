The graph is one of the most important structures in mathematics and computing, and is the central subject of [[Graph Theory|graph theory]]. A basic graph consists of a [[Set|set]] of [[Edge|edges]] connecting [[Vertex|verticies]]

# Mathematics 
## Types of Graphs
Due to the vast array of uses for graphs, there are also many different types of graphs defined. Perhaps the most broad classification is that of [[Directed Graph|directed]] and undirected graphs. 

# Computing
[[Data Structure|data structure]] for representing connections among items, and consists of [[Vertex|verticies]] connected by [[Edge|edges]].
