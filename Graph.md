# Graph

The graph is one of the most important structures in mathematics and computing, and is the central subject of [[Graph Theory|graph theory]]. A basic graph consists of a [[Set|set]] of [[Edge|edges]] connecting [[Vertex|verticies]]. In computing these edges and vertices represent connections among items within a [[Data Structure|data structure]].

# Types of Graphs

Due to the vast array of uses for graphs, there are also many different types of graphs defined. Perhaps the most broad classification is that of [[Directed Graph|directed]] and undirected graphs. 

There are also isomorphic graphs, which exists if there exists an [[Isomorphism|isomorphism]] between them.
