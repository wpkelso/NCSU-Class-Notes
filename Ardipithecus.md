#history

A species of [[Hominine]] that lived ~4.5 million years ago ([[Miocene|Late Miocene]] & [[Pliocene|Early Pliocene]]), in what is present day Ethiopia and Kenya (West [[Africa]]). The species is characterized as being extremely similar to chimpanzees, a far cry from what we think of as [[Homo Sapiens|modern humans]]--their brain wasn't much larger than a chimp's. However, they are nonetheless generally considered as one of the earliest ancestors of humans.
