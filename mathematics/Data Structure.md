# Data Structure

> [!info] Definition
> An object by which data in software can be conceptualized, organized, and which provides a framework by which that data can be manipulated.
> This organization of data is a foundational concept of [[Object Oriented Programming|object-oriented programming and thinking]].

## Modelling Real-World Scenarios in Data

At their core, data structures are about mapping real world scenarios and the data they generate into a structure that is simple to manipulate and understand.
Some scenarios naturally fit with certain data types well.
Data structures are often chained together to map more complex situations and sets of data.

## Models Divorced from Hardware

Data structures conceptually exist separate from the capabilities of computer hardware.
In practice this means that a data structure will always be the same in theory, but in practice will be _implemented differently_ and may have slightly different performance characteristics or hardware limitations.
