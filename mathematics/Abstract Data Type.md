# Abstract Data Type

> [!info] Definition
> The mathematical construct defining a [[Data Structure|data type]], concerned with the a collection of values and a set of operations possible on those values.

An abstract data type is a data type described by predefined user operations, without indication as to how each operation is implemented. An ADT can be implemented using different underlying [[Data Structure]]s, but you don't necessarily have to know the implementation to be able to use it.

E.g. A list is a common ADT, often implemented using an [[array]] or a [[linked list]].

List of Common ADTs:

- List (Implemented using an [[array]] or a [[linked list]])
- [[Dynamic Array]]
- [[Stack]]
- [[Queue (Data Structure)]]
- [[Deque]]
- [[Bag]]
- [[Set]] (Implemented using a [[binary search tree]] or a [[hash table]])
- [[Priority Queue]]
- [[Dictionary (Map)]]
