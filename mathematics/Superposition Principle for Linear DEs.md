>[!info] Theorem
>If $y_{1}$ is a solution to the [[Ordinary Differential Equation|differential equation]] $$ay''+by'+cy=f_1(t)$$
>and $y_2$ is a solution to $$ay''+by'+cy=f_2(t)$$
>then for an constants $k_1$ and $k_2$, the function $k_{1}y_{1}+k_{2}y_{2}$ is a solution to the differential equation $$ay''+by'+cy=k_{1}f_{1}(t)+k_{2}f_{2}(t)$$

This theorem is often used to solve [[Initial Value Problem|IVPs]] for [[Nonhomogeneous Differential Equation|nonhomogeneous differential equations]].
