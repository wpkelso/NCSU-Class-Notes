# Thevenin’s Theorem

“Any linear electrical network containing only voltage sources, current sources, and resistances can be replaced at terminals $A$-$B$ of the network by an equivalent combination of a voltage source in series with a resistance.”

This in theory allows any one-port linear network to be reduced to a single voltage source and a single impedance.

## Steps to Obtain with only Independent Sources:
1. Find the equivalent open-circuit voltage across the terminals A-B
2. To find the equivalent resistance, replace all voltage sources in the circuit with shorts and all current sources with an open circuit.
3. Redraw the circuit between terminals A-B as the equivalent circuit containing a voltage source and a current source
