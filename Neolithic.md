Translating to “New Stone Age” and naturally following the “[[Paleolithic|Old Stone Age]]”, the Neolithic is a period spanning from about 8000 BCE to 2000 BCE, and is the period in time in which humans started to form early settled communities and eventually civilizations during the [[Neolithic Revolution]].

## Important Sites
### Zawi Chemi
Site in Iraq in the [[Fertile Crescent]] consiting of a village with circular stone huts.. While not practicing agriculture, they harvest wild grains and domesticated sheep. Hunting was still an important source of food and material however. 

### Neolithic Jericho 
Located in an oasis in the Jordan valley in present day Palestine, Neolithic Jericho was a settlement  consisting of circular structures and a fortification wall with a massive stone tower. They domesticated wheat, barley, sheep, and goat.

### Ain Ghazal
Located in present day Jordan, Ain Ghazal is important as it shows the effect a sedentary community could have on the environment around them without proper management. With a population that peaked at around 2000 members, it was a large settlement that showed signs of progressive deforestation of the landscape and erosion of the topsoil. This would’ve caused the decline of agriculture and grazing, the disappearance of wildlife, and led to the eventual abandonment of the village.
