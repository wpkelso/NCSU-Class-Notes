# Neolithic

Translating to “New Stone Age” and naturally following the “[[Paleolithic|Old Stone Age]]”, the Neolithic is a period spanning from about 8000BCE to 2000BCE in Africa, Europe, and Asia, and is the period in time in which humans started to form early [[Neolithic Villages|settled communities]] and eventually civilizations during the [[Neolithic Revolution]]. The Neolithic is part of a refinement to the [[Three-Age System]] of classifying human pre-history.

## Important Developments

### Domestication of Animals

Provided a consistent source of food, clothing, tools, ornaments, and fertilizer. Additionally, domesticated animals such as horse and camel could be used as work animals; however, they were only fully domesticated after 3000BCE during the [[Bronze Age]].

### Domestication of Plants

The core of the human diet during the Neolithic transitioned to grains after their domestication from wild grasses. Additionally, legumes, vegetables, fruits, and nuts were all domesticated during this period, further expanding the regular options in the human diet.

### Technology

Around 8000BCE [[Metallurgy|metallurgy]] was developed, with the first metals being used consisting of copper, gold, and silver. Eventually bronze was created as the first alloy around 3000BCE.

Pottery was developed circa 6000BCE, marking another major expansion in our capabilities. It greatly enhanced storage capabilities, as well as being useful for cooking, as a construction material, etcetera.  Its ubiquity as well as the variances in the techniques used to make it over time make it of great importance for dating archaeological sites.

Circa 3500BCE the wheel was developed, allowing significantly easier transport on land in addition to many, many other technological achievements.
