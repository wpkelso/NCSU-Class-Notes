# Access Modifiers
#OOP #ECE309 

Access control to members in [[class]]es is done with [[Keyword Modifiers]] like the *public* and *private* keywords.
- **Public**: [[Member]]s and methods are accessible to all code
- **Private**: [[Member]]s and methods are only accessible by other member functions within the class.

The private keyword can be used to protect member fields from modification by outside functions or the like.
