[[Arithmetic]] in which all operations are limited to a fixed range between a minimum and a maximum value. If the result of an operation is above or below the maximum or minimum value respectively, it will be clamped to that minimum or maximum value. It’s name comes from the idea that a value becomes ‘saturated’ near it’s extreme values, as further additions or subtractions will not necessarily change the result.
