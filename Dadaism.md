# Dadaism

Began in 1916 in Zurich, Switzerland at the Cafe Voltaire.

The Dadaists were a collection of artists whose art was a reaction to the decimation of the youth in [[World War I]]. They emphasized that war was absurd and meaningless; that patriotism, morality, and [[Bourgeois]] values led to war. They were against art for the sake of beauty, as well as anti-logic.

The Dadas were very much influenced by the [[Futurism|Futurists]], but differed in the they were anti-war, while the Futurists embraced war.
