# Chinese Communist Party

Formed in the early 1920s, based on [[Marxism|Marxism-Leninism]].

After the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917 and the formation of the Communist International, Russia began to send advisers to the newly formed CCP to coordinate “moves toward worldwide revolution, which should be based initially on cooperation with ‘bourgeois’ interests.”
