# Chinese Communist Party

Formed in the early 1920s, based on [[Marxism|Marxism-Leninism]].

After the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917 and the formation of the [[Communist International]], Russia began to send advisers to the newly formed CCP to coordinate “moves toward worldwide revolution, which should be based initially on cooperation with ‘bourgeois’ interests.”

### Land Reform

Communist party members (cadres) were supposed to go to villages throughout China and work with the local revolutionaries to take land away from rich landholders and redistribute it according to communist ideology. This was primarily done through attacks on the old structure of landholding—tied to de-legitimizing the authority of the old land-holding families. They were met with a lot of distrust, and a lot of the peasantry was not overly revolutionary.

This was solved by discrediting the landowners through public trials, in which the members of a landholding family would be brought before a panel of cadres and told to “confess their sins” (how they had acquired land through oppression).

### Great Leap Forward (1958)

> [!quote] The Big Idea
> “China to surpass Britain in 15 years”

Campaign to use the party to mobilize the people forward, out of it’s colonial past and towards it’s place as a world power. It emphasized that the “People’s power is limitless.”

It was incredibly unsuccessful, resulting in a massive famine between 1959 and 1962. Steel production momentarily leaped with the initiatives, but it was quickly realized the steel produced under the “Backyard Blast Furnace” initiative was unusable, so production plummeted soon afterward. This failure resulted in a sidelining of Mao in regards to policy direction.

### CCP Pragmatists (1962-1965)

After the failure of the Great Leap Forward, the party was lead more by three policy makers known for being more pragmatic, rather than ideological: [[Deng Xiaopeng]], Liu Shaoqi, and Zhou Enlai. While this leadership was welcome, it eventually led to the Cultural Revolution beginning in 1966 and the return of [[Mao Zedong]] to the forefront.

### Cultural Revolution (1966-1969)

During the Cultural Revolution, Mao appealed to the youth to “Rectify” the party through the formation of the [[Red Guards]], centered around a direct commitment to Chairman Mao.
