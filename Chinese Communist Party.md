# Chinese Communist Party

Formed in the early 1920s, based on [[Marxism|Marxism-Leninism]].

After the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917 and the formation of the [[Communist International]], Russia began to send advisers to the newly formed CCP to coordinate “moves toward worldwide revolution, which should be based initially on cooperation with ‘bourgeois’ interests.”

### Land Reform

Communist party members (cadres) were supposed to go to villages throughout China and work with the local revolutionaries to take land away from rich landholders and redistribute it according to communist ideology. This was primarily done through attacks on the old structure of landholding—tied to de-legitimizing the authority of the old land-holding families. They were met with a lot of distrust, and a lot of the peasantry was not overly revolutionary.

This was solved by discrediting the landowners through public trials, in which the members of a landholding family would be brought before a panel of cadres and told to “confess their sins” (how they had acquired land through oppression).
