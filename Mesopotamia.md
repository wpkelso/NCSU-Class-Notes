# Mesopotamia

An area of land situated with the [[Fertile Crescent]] between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in present day Iraq. The rivers regularly flooded which covered the land in silt and made the area _very_ good for [[Agriculture|agriculture]]. Mesopotamia has a semi-arid climate with two seasons. As such, crops such as barely were particularly important, along with various fruits, dates, and figs. Domesticated animals were also crucial to the region, both as a source of resources and labor.

Resources commonly used in other parts of the world such as stone and wood were difficult to obtain, and the region lacked in metal, so these materials had to either be imported or done without. Additionally, the region lacks natural barriers and protection from invasion, making it very vulnerable to hostile external forces.

## Religion

As a pre-scientific society with no understanding of natural causation, religion played an important part in the life of Mesopotamians. Humans maintained good relations with the [[Polytheism|gods]] through the priesthood, and worshipped them through prayers and sacrifice. The priests would communicate with the divine through dreams, omens, and magic.

Like in many cultures, there was a notion of the [[Afterlife]], in the form of the “House of Dust,” where souls would go to spend all eternity after they died. Additionally, as common within farming societies, fertility was an important part of the religion, with activities such as cultic prostitution being engaged in.

Each city-state had a patron deity, but many others were worshipped as well—hundreds of deities were included in the Mesopotamian pantheon. Like in many other cultures, Mesopotamian gods were anthropomorphic with human personalities, but none had absolute power; all were limited in some way.
