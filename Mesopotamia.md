# Mesopotamia

An area of land situated with the [[Fertile Crescent]] between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in present day Iraq. The rivers regularly flooded which covered the land in silt and made the area *very* good for [[Agriculture|agriculture]]. Mesopotamia has a semi-arid climate with two seasons. As such, crops such as barely were particularly important, along with various fruits, dates, and figs. Domesticated animals were also crucial to the region, both as a source of resources and labor.

Resources commonly used in other parts of the world such as stone and wood were difficult to obtain, and the region lacked in metal, so these materials had to either be imported or done without. Additionally, the region lacks natural barriers and protection from invasion, making it very vulnerable to hostile external forces.
