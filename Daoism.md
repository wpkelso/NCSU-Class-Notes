Grew out of the "War of the Philosophers" and derived from the teachings of [[Laozi]] Daoism is a philosophy that hinges on the constant cyclical change of the world. Literally translated, the "Dao" refers to "the way", or the way things develop naturally and living beings grow in accordance with cosmic laws.

To an extent, Daoism is a philosophy of non-action, and of a [[Naturalism|naturalistic universe]].
