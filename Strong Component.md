# Strong Component

The strong component(s) of a [[Directed Graph|directed graph]] is a set of vertices where, beginning at one vertex in the set, there is a path to all other vertices in the set. This quality is then repeatable for every other vertex in the set. Should this quality hold true, then the set is considered a “strong component” or a “strongly connected component”. Commonly, the strong component is calculated using the [[Transitive Closure|transitive closure]] of the graph.
