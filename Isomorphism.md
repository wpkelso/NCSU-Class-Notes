# Isomorphism

An isomorphism between two graphs is defined simply as a [[Function|function]] that renames the vertices of a [[Graph|graph]] . More formally, it is a bijection $f:V_{1}\to V_{2}$ between the vertices of the graphs such that $\{ a, b \}$ is an edge in $G_{1}$ iff $\{ f(a), f(b) \}$ is an edge in $G_{2}$.
