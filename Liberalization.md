# Liberalization

## China

Post-[[Chinese Communist Party#Cultural Revolution (1966-1969)|Cultural Revolution]], China under [[Deng Xiaopeng]] underwent a policy of liberalization, trading some ideology for pragmatism. One of the biggest parts of this liberalization was the creation of “Special Economic Zones” in 1979 and subsequently expanded. In these zones, the laws surrounding property rights were modified to allow for more traditional [[Capitalism|capitalistic]] investment.
