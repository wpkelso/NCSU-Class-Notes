# Constructors
#OOP #ECE309 

Special [[member]] functions that intialize an instance of a [[class]] when it is declared. They are never called explicitly, only implicitly when the [[object]] is declared.
*Note: a class can have many constructors, as long as they have different arguments*

Special rules for C++:
- Always have the name name as the class
- Have no return type or value
- May take no arguments or many arguments
