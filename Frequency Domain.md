#signal_analysis #mathematics 
Alternative space for [[Signal]] analysis not based on a [[Systems]] value over time, but rather the frequencies that make up that signal.

Conversion between the frequency domain and the time domain is done using the [[Fourier Transform]] and the [[Inverse Fourier Transform]], similar to the [[Laplace Transform]] and the [[Inverse Laplace Transform]] for conversion between the time domain and the s-domain.
