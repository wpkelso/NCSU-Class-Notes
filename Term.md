# Term

In a [[First-Order Language|first-order language]] $\mathscr{L}$, a term is considered to be defined by the following:
1. Every variable is a term
2. Every constant symbol is a term
3. If $f$ is an $n$-place function symbol and $t_{1}, \dots, t_{n}$ are terms, then $f(t_{1},\dots,t_{n})$ is a term
4. Nothing else is a term

>[!note] 
>A *closed term*  is defined as a term containing no variables

These define [[Mathematical Induction|inductively]] all possible terms in the language.
