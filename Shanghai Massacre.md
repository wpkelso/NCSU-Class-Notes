# Shanghai Massacre

After the capture of Shanghai and the securing of power by the [[Guomindang]] following the [[United Front#United Front#1926 Northern Expedition]], the Guomindang turned on their former Communist allies.
Using local gangs, they massacred [[Chinese Communist Party|communist]] supporters in the city and drove them into the countryside.
