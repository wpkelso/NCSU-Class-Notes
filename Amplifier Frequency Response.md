# Amplifier Frequency Response

## Analysis

### Short-Circuit Time Constant Method

The SCTC method produces an estimate for $\omega_{L}$ where $\omega_{L}=\sum^{n}_{i=1} {\frac{1}{R_{iS}C_{i}}}$. $R_{iS}$ is the resistance at the terminals of the $i$-th capacitor $C_{i}$, with all other capacitors replaced with short circuits. This gives the _lower cutoff frequency_ for a network with $n$ coupling and bypass capacitors.
