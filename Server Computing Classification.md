# Server Computing Classification

Computers specialized to process large volumes of information very quickly, as well as to store and retrieve massive amounts of data. These capabilities in speed and volume come at the trade-off of steep increases in the amount of power required for operation, as well as massive amounts of heat generation. These requirements make server computing an expensive enterprise.

Often times, banks of servers are used in [[Parallel Computing|parallel computing]] environments to create the large blocks of compute cores required.
