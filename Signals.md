# Signals
#SignalAnalysis 
A physical quantity that varies with some independent variable that can be used to convey information.

Also defined as a value or information relative to an independent variable (usually time); a mathematical function with meaning
- One signal can be built from other signals (primarily through addition and multiplication)
- Can be acted on by [[systems]]


### Continuous-time Signals $x(t)$
- $x_{d}[n]=x(nT)$
- Average will be calculated using an integral
### Discrete-time Signals $x[n]$
- *often* obtained by sampling CT signal
- taken at values $nT$ (where T is the sampling period)
- A smaller $T$ will have a greater number of samples, $n$ must be an integer
- Average will be calculated with a sum ($\Sigma$)

### Distortion
When resulting from overlap, occurs because the time between the impulses is shorter than the length of the input signal
