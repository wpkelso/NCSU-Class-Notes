# Digital Signals
#signal_analysis 
Exist in a discrete space, so there is no continuous signal

### Types
- Kronecker's Delta : Similar to the [[Dirac Delta Function]]; Exists as a piecewise function where the function is 1 at n = x, and 0 elsewhere
- Impulse: Similar to the [[Impulse]] in the time domain, just existing in the discrete domain rather than the continuous domain
