A mathematical operation constituting the combination of two time-varying functions ([[Signal|Signals]]). Convolution can be accomplished using the [[Convolution Integral]]. The roles of the signals involved in convolution can be reversed, as convolution is a commutative operation.

> [!note] Relationship between Convolution and Modulation
> Convolution and [[Modulation]] are related in that one operation can be transformed into another through the use of the [[Fourier Transform]]. Thus, convolution in one domain is modulation in the other, $h(t)=f(t)g(t)\equiv H(\omega)=F(\omega)\ast G(\omega)$, and vice versa.
