# Multigraph

A multigraph is defined as a graph, where there can be any number of [[Edge|edges]] between two [[Vertex|vertices]]. This concept can be further expanded on to define both the directed and undirected forms of a multigraph, based on the [[Directed Graph|directed]] and [[Graph|undirected]] forms of a graph respectively. As it is often clear through context, the term **graph** is commonly used to refer to both graphs and multigraphs.
