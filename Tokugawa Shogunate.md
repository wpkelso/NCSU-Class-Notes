# Tokugawa Shogunate

The [[Shogunate]] regime that ruled in [[Japan]] between 1603 and 1868, founded by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]. It held the real political and administrative power, rather than the [[Japanese Imperial Court]] (although they were technically only servants to the Emperor).

It upheld the rigid class system of [[Confucianism]], but stressed that the hereditary samurai were at the top of the order, rather than the educated scholar-gentry.

## Contradictions Present within the Shogunate

1. The fluidity of Urban and Cultural development, in spite of the rigid hierarchy of Tokugawa order
2. Policy of Exclusion (Sakoku Edit of 1635) - prevented [{Daimyo}] from having independent relations with foreigners and acquiring arms
	- Still allowed the Dutchâ€”and only the Dutch, to trade from an island off Nagasaki
