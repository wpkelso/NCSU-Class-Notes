# Tokugawa Shogunate

The [[Shogunate]] regime that ruled in [[Japan]] between 1603 and 1868, founded by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]. It held the real political and administrative power, rather than the [[Japanese Imperial Court]] (although they were technically only servants to the Emperor).

It upheld the rigid class system of [[Confucianism]], but stressed that the hereditary samurai were at the top of the order, rather than the educated scholar-gentry.

## Contradictions Present within the Shogunate

1. The fluidity of Urban and Cultural development, in spite of the rigid hierarchy of Tokugawa order
2. Policy of Exclusion (Sakoku Edit of 1635) - prevented [{Daimyo}] from having independent relations with foreigners and acquiring arms
    - Still allowed the Dutch—and only the Dutch, to trade from an island off Nagasaki

## Mid-19th Century Crisis

In 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry arrived in Edo Bay and forcibly opened Japan to US/Foreign trade.

## Bakumatsu Period (1852-1868)

- period of widespread social unrest following Tokugawa efforts to come to terms with foreign threats to power
- Longstanding tensions within Tokugawa society, including questions about the loyalty of “outer domains” (notably Choshu and Satsuma) find new reflection in challenges to Tokugawa authority as they are unable to effectively deal with outside threats
- Challenge to Shogunate tied to new visions of Japanese identity bound up with the symbolic position of the Emperor

This period culminated in the first of the “Unequal Treaties” forced on Japan in 1858. The aftermath of this treaty included the 1860 Japanese delegation to Washington, as well as the 1860 assassination of Ii Naosuke (leading minister in the Tokugawa government) by xenophobic samurai acting in the name of loyalty to the Emperor.
