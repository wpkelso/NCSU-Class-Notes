#compilers 
"Deriving the syntactic structure of the program." In other words, parsing figures out of the words of the program are in a valid structure. This is done using a [[Grammar|grammar]].

If an input string can be reduced to terminals, it is said to **parse**. This quality can be figured out through the use of a [[Parse Tree]]. If you can draw a parse tree for a program, then it will parse! This only means though that it is a valid program for the grammar, as there may be language rules not enforced by the grammar.
