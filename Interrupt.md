A signal showing that a particular event has happened, outside of the software environment. When triggered an interrupt will force the [[Computer Processor|computer processor]] to put whatever it was doing on hold to service it, running and [[Interrupt Service Routine|ISR]] to handle the event.

> An interrupt will never be called from within user code
