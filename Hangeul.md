## How it works
The [[Korea|Korean]] writing system is a [[Logosyllabism|logosyllabic]] system of writing, where consonant and vowel glyphs are combined into sets of 2, 3, or 4 to form the individual characters, with each character representing a syllable.

## Origins
The original writing system used in Korea was, like in [[Japan]], the [[Chinese Writing Systems|Chinese script]] adapted to fit the spoken Korean language.
