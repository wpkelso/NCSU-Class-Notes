## How it works

The [[Korea|Korean]] writing system is an [[Alphabet|alphabetic]] system of writing, where consonant and vowel glyphs are combined into sets of 2, 3, or 4 to form the individual characters, with each character representing a syllable.

## Origins

The original writing system used in Korea was, like in [[Japan]], the [[Chinese Writing Systems|Chinese script]] adapted to fit the spoken [[Korean Language|Korean language]]. However, in 1443, the [[King 세종|fourth king of Joseon]] created Hunminjeongeum (old name of Hangeul) with the intention that it would allow more people in Korea to achieve literacy. As the Chinese character system was complex and large, really only the nobility achieved literacy, and scribes for the commoners were few and far between. The original set of Hangeul characters contained 28 letters: eight basic (ㄱ, ㄴ, ㅁ, ㅅ, ㅇ, . , ㅡ, ㅣ), with the other being an expansion of those forms.

> Since the creation of the initial set of 28 characters, 4 have fallen out of use and so the current set of letters numbers 24.

## Consonant Pronunciations

While individual pronunciation rules may change based on context, letters will almost always follow the rules laid out in the table below.
