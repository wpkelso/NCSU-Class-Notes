## Korean Pronunciation
In [[Korean Language|Korean]], consonant clusters are not allowed. However, clusters of two consonants may appear at the end of a syllable in the final consonant position. In this case, one of the sounds will drop, or otherwise be moved to another syllable through [[Re-Syllabification|re-syllabification]].

| Consonant Cluster | Sound Pronounced                  |

| ㄳ                | ㄱ                                |
| ㄶ                | ㄴ                                |
| ㄻ                | ㅁ                                |
| ㄽ                | ㄹ                                |
