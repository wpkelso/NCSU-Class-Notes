# Shape

Flat, enclosed areas created by connecting lines, or surrounding an area by other shapes. They can also be _implied_ through boundaries defined by color, texture, value, or directional variations. It is different from [[Form]] in that it exists only in 2-Dimensional space, while form exists only in 3-Dimensional space.

## Positive Shape

The dominant or foreground shape(s). Also known as the figure.

## Negative Shape

The surrounding or receding shape(s). Also known as the ground.
