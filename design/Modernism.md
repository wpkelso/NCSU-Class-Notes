Grew out of [[Futurism]], with an emphasis on technology and machines. In particular, it represented the following thoughts and ideas:

## Ideas

- Machines represent progress
- Science & technology should be celebrated
- Society is organized around [[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] production
- Humans can control nature
- Action and functionalism valued
- New materials exploited
- Forms & materials of industry become the [[Machine Aesthetic]] (the style of the time)

## Innovations

- Re-conceptualization of typography & the printed page
- Use of letters and math symbols as images
- Altered the predictability of the printed word
- Distorted words for expression
- Word usage ignored meaning and became sounds
