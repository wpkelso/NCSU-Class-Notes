# Cubism
Unique for no fixed perspective, consistent light source, or even accurate modelling of the 3D. Important for it’s use of printed materials, the use of letterforms and real materials as an image, and the technique of ‘collage’.

## Analytic Cubism 

Straight-edged planes used to abstract space

## Synthetic Cubism

Artists less interested in retaining recognizable of subject matter, with more emphasis placed on space
