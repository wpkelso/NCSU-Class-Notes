# Varna System

A status system utilized across [[India]] that was derived from ancient texts, and legitimized through the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] ideas of rebirth.

1. [[Brahmins]] - Priests, there because they had followed [[Dharma]] and had good [[Karma]]
2. [[Kshatriyas]] - Rulers and warriors
3. [[Vaishyas]] - Peasants and traders
4. [[Shudras]] - Laborers
5. Untouchables - considered impure because of their line of work (butchers, grave diggers, trash collectors, etc.)

The top three classes were considered to have been reborn into that class.
