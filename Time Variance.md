# Time Variance/Invariance
A system is time invariant if it behaces in the same way regardless of the current time

If $x(t-t_0) \text{ -> System -> }y(t-t_0)$ for all $t_0$ then the system is time invariant; otherwise it is time varying

#### How to check:
*Usually, if the output includes an function of time other than x(t), it is time-variant.*
#### Method 1:
If the system $x(t-t_0) \text{ -> System -> }y(t-t_0)$ with the shifted input $x_{2}(t)=x_{1}(t-t_0)$ applied yields $y_{2}(t)=y_{1}(t-t_0)$ then the system is time invariable.

##### Method 2:
- *Counter example, simple way to disprove TI*
- *If you cannot find a counter example, method 1 must be used*
