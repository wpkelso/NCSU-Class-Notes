Living in [[Europe]] and [[Africa| the Middle East]] between 300 and 30 thousand years ago, Homo Neaderthalis was a species of proto-humans alive around the same time as early [[Homo Sapiens]]. It had a slightly larger brain than modern humans, and were extremely good hunters, eating primarily big game. However, this diet meant that they were thinly scattered, which is believed to have lead to their decline.
