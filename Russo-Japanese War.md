# Russo-Japanese War

War in 1904 and 1905 between Russia and Japan, after Japan signs the first of it’s “Equal” treaties with a European power—Britain saw Japan as a counterweight to the influence of Russia in the region. This was ended in a victory for Japan, after an extremely intense period of fighting in Manchuria, with large amounts of casualties on both sides.
