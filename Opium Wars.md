# Opium Wars

The opium trade had been a long-standing thing in [[China]]—specifically in the south of China through the [[Canton System]], but in the late 18th century ballooned into a massive trade in exchange for tea, facilitated by the growing control of [[India]] by the [[British East India Company]].

The introduction of smoking opium, resultant addiction epidemic, and the severe change in the balance of power led to the Qing government banning the import of opium from the early 18th century.

## Macartney Mission (1793)

Attempt by the East India company to negotiate better terms with the Chinese with regard to Opium. It ultimately failed, due to various differences between the two parties.

## End of East India Company Monopoly (1833)

In 1833 the BEIC lost it’s monopoly on the opium trade, causing a massive influx in the amount of opium being imported into China. This created an internal Qing debate over how to deal with the crisis, leading to two schools of thought being developed:

1. Crack down on the trade, harshly enforcing it
2. Legalize & tax

Ultimately, the emperor decided to come down on the side of suppression, arguing that being pragmatic would not be conducive to power. The government seizes all of the opium in Guangzhou and shuts down the trade, prompting a military response from the British.
