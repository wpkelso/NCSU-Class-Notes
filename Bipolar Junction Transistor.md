# Bipolar Junction Transistor

Bipolar junction transistors are three-layer devices consisting of alternating layers of n- and p-type [[Semiconductor|semiconductors]], called the emitter (E), the base (B), and the collector (C).

Given this, there are two basic types of BJTs: NPN and PNP, matching their layering.

## Simplified Model

A simplified model for a BJT exists, consisting of two [[Diode|diodes]] placed back-to-back. This model shows more easily the source of the 4 operational regions for a BJT.

## Operation Regions

| BE Junction | BC Junction | Region of Operation |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| Forward     | Reverse     | Forward Active      |
| Reverse     | Forward     | Reverse Active      |
| Reverse     | Reverse     | Cutoff              |
| Forward     | Forward     | Saturation          |
