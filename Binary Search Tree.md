# Binary Search Tree
#dataStructure #ECE309 

A binary search tree is a [[binary tree]] that has nodes arranged in a particular order. Namely:
- The left subtree of a node has nodes which are only lesser than that node's key
- The Right subtree of a node has nodes which are only greater than that node's key
- Each node has distinct keys and duplicates are not allowed in binary search trees
- The left and right subtree must also be a binary search tree

*A binary search tree is a binary tree, but a binary tree is not a binary serach tree*
