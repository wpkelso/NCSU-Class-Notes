# Class
#OOP #ECE309 

**Definition:** A specific syntactic constuct for describing a kind of [[Object]]. No memory is reserved, only a structure for the object is declared.

*Comparable to C structs*
Classes represent a new user defined data type, and have fields (called [[Member]]s) like structs. They may also have member functions (methods), that are used strictly within the confines of an instance of a class.

Access control to members in classes is done with [[Keyword Modifiers]] like the *public* and *private* keywords.
