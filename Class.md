#OOP #programming  

**Definition:** A specific syntactic construct for describing a kind of [[Object]]. No [[Memory|memory]] is reserved, only a structure for the object is declared.

*Comparable to C structs*
Classes represent a new user defined [[Data Type|data type]], and have fields (called [[Member|members]]) like structs. They may also have member functions (methods), that are used strictly within the confines of an instance of a class.

Access control to members in classes is done with [[Keyword Modifiers]] like the *public* and *private* keywords.
