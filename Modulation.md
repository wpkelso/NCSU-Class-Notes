A mathematical operation which constitutes the product of two time-varying functions ([[Signal|signals]]). Modulation can be represented by the equation $y(t)=s(t)c(t)$ where $y(t)$ is the modulated signal, $c(t)$ is the ‘carrier’ signal, and $s(t)$ is the signal being modulated (and containing the information).

## Use Case: Amplitude Modulation
In [[Amplitude Modulation|AM]] applications, this looks like the information signal $s(t)$ being modulated by the carrier signal $c(t)=\sin (\omega_{c}t+\phi)$.
