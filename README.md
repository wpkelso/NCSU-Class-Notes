# notes
These are my personal class notes that I'm letting be open to the world. Written in the Obsidian markdown environment, but as the repo consists entirely of plain text markdown files it naturally can be used in most other places that support markdown syntax (perhaps missing some syntax that is specific to Obsidian or less widely supported).
Not everything has been re-written or sanitized of copyrighted or un-paraphrased content (I'm unsure of the exact rules/practices for personal use cases that are also publicly visible).
