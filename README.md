# Williamâ€™s Notes

This vault/repo consists entirely of notes I have taken either for class, or while working on personal projects. Primarily written to use the Obsidian markdown environment, this repo is best use within Obsidian using the plugins attached to this vault. However, it will work anywhere valid markdown will, save for the few bits of syntax that are environment specific or not as widely supported.

Not everything has been re-written or sanitized of copyrighted or un-paraphrased content.
