Velocity saturation is a phenomenon where, as the velocity of carriers cannot indefinitely increase (certainly not to more than the speed of light), electrical field increases above a certain point in [[Semiconductor|semiconductor]] materials reach a [[Saturation Arithmetic|saturation]] point. This is fixed for each material, and as such any assumption of a linear velocity-field relationship is invalid above this point.
