The modulation depth of a [[Modulation|modulation scheme]] describes by how much the modulated carrier wave varies around its unmodulated level.

## Definition for Amplitude Modulation
In [[Amplitude Modulation|amplitude modulation]] schemes, the modulation index can be defined as $$m=\frac{\text{peak value of }m(t)}{A}=\frac{M}{A}$$ where $M$ and $A$ are the modulation amplitude and carrier amplitude, respectively. Thus, the modulation index is expressed as a percentage of how close the envelope wave comes to touching itself in respect to the unmodulated carrier waveâ€™s amplitude.
