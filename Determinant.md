The determinant for a 2 x 2 matrix is as follows
$$\begin{equation*}
|A|=
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b  \\ c & d
\end{bmatrix}
=ad-bc
\end{equation*}
$$
>[!note] Definition
>A [[Scalar|scalar value]] that is a function of the entries of a square [[Matrix|matrix]]
>*Denoted:* $\det A, |A|, \text{or} \det(A)$

## Taking the Determinant of Larger Matrices
For larger matrices, manipulating the matrix is required, as show

## Properties
1. The determinant of the [[Identity Matrix|identity matrix]] is 1
2. The exchange of 2 rows or 2 columns multiplies the determinant by  -1
3. Multiplying a row by a number $n$ multiplies the determinant by $n$
4. Adding a multiple of a row or column to another row or column **does not** change the determinant
