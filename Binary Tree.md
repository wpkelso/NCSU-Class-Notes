# Binary Tree

A binary tree is a directed graph in which every parent [[Vertex|node]] has a maximum of two child nodes. From a [[Set Theory|set theory]] point of view, this means that the set of children for a parent node can consist of either the empty set, a singleton, or of two elements.

The exact definition of a binary tree can change between authors, but generally the above is the base definition.

## Uses in Computing

Binary trees hold many uses in computing and programming, commonly as a way of storing data that is bifurcating. It is also the underlying [[Data Structure|structure]] for many other data structures, in particular [[Binary Search Tree|binary search trees]].
