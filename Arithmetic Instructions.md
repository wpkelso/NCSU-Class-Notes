Arithmetic instructions implement basic [[Arithmetic]] operations
```asm
1) ADD R1 R2 R3

2) ADDI R1 R2 #4
```
Type 1: Adds two [[Register|register]] together and stores the result in a third register
Type 2 (Add Immediate): Adds a register and an immediate together and stores the result in a third register

A [[Reduced Instruction-Set Computers|RISC]] implementation only uses the [[Arithmetic Logic Unit]], so no [[Memory|memory]] operations are allowed.
