# Neolithic Villages

## Important or Key Characteristics

- Most located in the upland hill country of the [[Mesopotamia]]
- Nearly all unfortified
- Usually ranged from about 5 to 40 acres of area
- Population ranged from around 100 to 2000
- Produced food from a combination of domesticated plants and animals

## Major Sites

### Zawi Chemi

Site in Iraq in the [[Mesopotamia]] consiting of a village with circular stone huts.. While not practicing agriculture, they harvest wild grains and domesticated sheep. Hunting was still an important source of food and material however.

### Neolithic Jericho

Located in an oasis in the Jordan valley in present day Palestine, Neolithic Jericho was a settlement consisting of circular structures and a fortification wall with a massive stone tower. They domesticated wheat, barley, sheep, and goat.

### Ain Ghazal

Located in present day Jordan, Ain Ghazal is important as it shows the effect a sedentary community could have on the environment around them without proper management. With a population that peaked at around 2000 members, it was a large settlement that showed signs of progressive deforestation of the landscape and erosion of the topsoil. This wouldâ€™ve caused the decline of agriculture and grazing, the disappearance of wildlife, and led to the eventual abandonment of the village.

### Jarmo

Occupied around 6750 BCE in the foothills of the Zagros mountains of Northeastern Iraq, Jarmo was fairly typical of a neolithic village. It occupied around three to four acres, and domesticated wheat, barley, lentils, sheep, goats, dogs, and pigs, with evidence for the continued harvest of wild grains and the hunting of wild cattle and onagers.
