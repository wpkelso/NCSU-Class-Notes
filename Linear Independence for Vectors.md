# Linear Independence of Vectors
#signal_analysis 
Given a [[Vector (Math)]], for $a_{1}v_{1}+\text{...}+a_{n}v_{n}=\text{**0**}$
- if $a_{i}=0$, for all $i$, then "linearly independent"
- if not all $a_{i}=0$, then "linearly dependent"

Essentially, if one vector can be multiplied by a single value to produce a second vector, those two vectors are linearly dependent. Additionally if one vector can be produced by the sum of two or more other vectors, the initial vector and and the collection of other vectors are considered linearly dependent (occurs when vectors are coplanar).
