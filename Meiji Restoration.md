# Meiji Restoration

Following the overthrow of the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]], the Emperor was moved to Edo (now renamed Tokyo) and restored of his administrative power. It represented the Emperor becoming the legal head of Japan again (however he was nowhere near making all of the decisions of the country, most things were done in his name instead).

## Meiji Charter Oath (1868)

- In direct contradiction to [[Confucianism|Confucian values]], although not overtly stated
- Vague echoes of the US Constitution in some of it’s ideals
- “Knowledge shall be sought throughout the world so as to strengthen the foundation of imperial rule”—directly contradicts the xenophobia that fueled the revolution against the Tokugawa

## Self-Strengthening

As happened in China, the Meiji undertook a policy of self-strengthening by emulating and adapting the Western ways of doing things to strengthen themselves and resist foreign pressures.

### Key Reforms (1860s-70s)

1. [[Daimyo]] domains transformed into prefectures
2. Privileges of samurai abolished, with samurai stipends ultimately converted into bonds
3. An emphasis on domestic industry and export growth made a “national” priority
4. Feudal structure of samurai army transformed into “national” army, with peasants armed and trained
    - Yamagata Aritomo reorganized the army
    - Soldiers were no longer samurai, but instead predominantly peasant conscripts, trained and organized according to European models for a “national” army
5. Education and politics were focused on mobilizing and controlling the “People”
    - Imperial Rescript on Education (1890)

### Meiji Political Order

1. Question of the “People” and the State
2. Constitutional Government based on European Models
3. Loyalty to the Emperor defines the _kokutai_ (“national polity”)
4. Rule by [[Oligarchy|oligarchy]]; carefully controlled participation by the “people”
    - Creation of the Freedom and People’s Rights Party, led by Itagaki Daisuke

> [!note] 
> The Meiji constitution was considered to be a “Gift from the Emperor to the People”

## End of the Meiji Era (1912)

In 1912 the Meiji emperor died. During his reign, Japan has succeeded in forcing revisions of Unequal Treaties and had begun to sign treaties of alliance with Europeans on equal terms. Additionally, Japan had become an imperial power in East Asia, annexing Taiwan as a colony in 1895, as well as annexing Korea as a colony in 1910.
