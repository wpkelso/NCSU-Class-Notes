# India

## Geography & Climate

Situated on the Indian Subcontinent in [[Asia|south Asia]], India historically encompasses the lands from the southern edges of the Himalayas to the coasts of the Arabian sea and the Indian Ocean.

The north of the continent is dominated by the Ganges River plain, which is historically the center of population density in the region. In the west of the region (present day Pakistan), lies the Indus River valley, where [[Indus River Valley Civilization|Mohenjo-Daro]] was located—one of the cradles of civilization of the ancient world.

### Monsoon Climate

The subcontinent experiences a seasonal shift in climate, marked by a wet season and a dry season. In India, this is caused by a shift in the major wind patterns between the Indian Ocean and the Himalayas.

## Linguistics

The largest linguist distinction in the subcontinent is between the [[Indo-European Languages|Indo-European/Indo-Aryan language family]] that dominates the north, and the [[Dravidian Languages|Dravidian language family]] that dominates the southern part of the region.

However, these are not the only two language families present within the region: many smaller pockets of other families are scattered throughout the region.

## Religion

- [[Hinduism]] is the majority religion presently, but there is an extreme diversity in the beliefs, organization, and practices across the region
- [[Buddhism]] was important historically, but largely disappeared from the region by 1800
- [[Islam]] became significant from c. 1200 onward, eventually claiming approximately 25% of the population in 1800
- Other smaller religions include Jainism, Skihism, and [[Christianity]]

Islam is heavily prevalent in the northwest of the region (present Pakistan), as well as in the northeast.

## Social Structure

The Indian social structure is based around a caste system. It has two systems, with the [[Varna System]] being what is traditionally referred to as the “Caste System”. Eventually, the caste system became associated with the [[Jati System]], which differentiated people by birth across multiple, regionally distinct, occupational, lineage, ethnic groups.

>In the pre-modern era, religious and caste boundaries were fluid, and the hierarchies were very often contested.
