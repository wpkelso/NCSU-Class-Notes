# Binary Expression Tree

As the name suggests, a binary expression tree is a specific example of a [[Binary Tree|binary tree]], used to represent expressions (commonly [[Algebra|algebraic]] and [[Boolean|boolean]] expressions). A BET is not restricted to only binary operations, but can also be used to represent unary operations.

A binary expression tree is very commonly used with [[Postfix Notation|postfix notation]] in mathematical parsing using [[Stack|stacks]].
