A 700-verse [[Hinduism|Hindu]] scripture that is a part of the epic of [[Mahabharata]], and follows a framework of dialogue between prince Arjuna and his guide and charioteer Krishna.

It presents a synthesis of Hindu ideas about [[Dharma|dharma]], theistic bhakti, and the yogic ideals of moksha. The Gita is the most revered of all Hindu texts, with many leaders of the Indian Independence movement such as [[Mahatma Gandhi]] taking inspiration from its selfless calls to action.
