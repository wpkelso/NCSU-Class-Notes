Eigenvectors are a special [[Set|set]] of [[Vector (Math)|vectors]] associated with linear systems of equations. They are very commonly used in [[Differential Equation|differential equation]] problem solving in fields such as stability physics, small oscillations of vibrating systems, etcetera.

>[!info] Left and Right Eigenvectors
>Mathematically speaking, two types of eigenvectors exist. The **right** eigenvector can be defined as a column vector $X_R$ satisfying the equation $$AX_R=\lambda_RX_R$$ and the **left** eigenvector can be defined as a row vector $X_R$ satisfying the equation $$AX_L=\lambda_LX_L$$
