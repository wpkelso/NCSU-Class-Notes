# Sumeria

Considered to be the world’s oldest civilization—beginning around 3200BCE, Sumeria was a collection of [[City-State|city-states]] in [[Mesopotamia]], each with their own king.

Each Sumerian city was heavily fortified, with a massive temple called a Zigguraut forming the religious heart of the state. Additionally, Sumeria had a social class structure, setting a model for many later civilizations. This structure consisted of the following social classes, laid out from most important to least important:

1. The king, the royal family, and the royal bureaucracy
2. The priesthood
3. Soldiers
4. Artisans and merchants
5. Peasant free land holders and tenant farmers
6. Slaves

## Historical Periods

Roughly three major periods in Sumerian history are considered:

1. The Early Dynastic Period, from around 3200-2400BCE
2. Sargon of Akkad and the Akkadian Empire, from around 2100-2000BCE
	- A short lived empire that collapsed due to drought and invasion
	- Likely the first empire in history
1. The Ur III Period, from around 2100-2000BCE
	- Also referred to as the “Sumerian Renaissance,” this is the last great flowering of Sumerian culture
	- The oldest known copies of the Epic of Gilgamesh are from this period
