# Rope

The rope is a data structure derived from the [[Binary Search Tree]] in which a sequence of characters is stored as aetcetera tree where each [[Vertex|node]] holds the length of it’s left sub-rope, and each leaf node holds a `string/substring` and the length of that string. The length of the individual strings are implementation-specified, but shouldn’t be important for the end user.

As the nature of each part of the rope is slightly different, it is not a mono-culture of nodes. Leaf nodes are slightly different from parent nodes, etcetera.

## Types of Nodes

## Operations

### Concatenation

### Substring 

### Rebalance
