# Equinumerosity

Equinumerosity is an equivalence [[Relation|relation]] defined between two sets if there is a bijection between those two sets. Formally, this is written as $A\approx B$, iff there is a [[Function|bijection]] $f:A\to B$.

## Related Size Relations
+ $A$ is no larger than $B$ ($A \preceq B$) iff there is an injection $f : A \to B$.
+ $B$ is smaller than $B$ ($A \prec B$) iff there is an injection $f : A \to B$.
