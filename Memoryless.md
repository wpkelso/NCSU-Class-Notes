# Memoryless
#SignalAnalysis 
- a system is memoryless if the output depends only on the value of the current input, otherwise it is described as having memory
- general approach requires checking to see if there is any dependence on past or future inputs
- A system can still be memoryless ***as long as*** the system is dependent only on the **current input**. Modulation taking from the past or future doesn't matter, as long as the input is still the current input


*If a system is memoryless, then it is implied to follow [[Causability]] as well*
