# Neolithic Revolution

The Neolithic Revolution was a period spanning throughout the entire [[Neolithic]] marked by massive shifts in both the natural and man-made world that enabled progression in civilization. Two major changes were the end of the [[Pleistocene|last ice age]] in 8000BCE that dramatically changed the world climate, as well as the permanent increase of the [[Homo Sapiens|Human]] population beyond the capacity that could be sustained by a hunter/gatherer economy due to the introduction of primitive [[Agriculture|agriculture]].
