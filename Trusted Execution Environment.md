# Trusted Execution Environment

A trusted execution environment is a protected area of the main [[Computer Processor|processor]] that can be used to guarantee confidentiality of code and data loaded inside of it. It does this through prevention of unauthorized entities outside of the TEE from modifying data, and from altering or replacing code.

This protection is enabled through (often hardware-implemented) architectural security that is confidential, immutable, and unique.
