A form of classification of [[Parallel Computing|parallel computing architectures]].

# Classifications
Within the taxonomy, machines are classified by the number of instruction streams and the number of data streams. All of the classifications within the taxonomy really are extensions of SISD, just in different dimensions.

- Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)
- Multiple Instruction Single Data (MISD)
- Multiple Instruction Multiple Data (MIMD)
