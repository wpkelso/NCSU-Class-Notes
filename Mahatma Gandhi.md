# Mahatma Gandhi

Came from a relatively well off family from Gujarat in western [[India]], and was heavily educated in the British education system, eventually getting a law degree in England. However, he was ultimately a complete disaster of a lawyer, botching several of the cases that he got. This resulted in him being sent to work at an Indian law firm in South Africa. 

## Activism

After the end of [[World War I]], Gandhi accused the British of betraying their promise to reform by maintaining strong imperial police powers and harsh punishments for “sedition” under the [[Rowlatt Acts]]

### Non-Cooperation (1920-1922)

Movement within the [[Indian National Congress]] that focused on boycotting of British councils, schools, and courts as well as other non-violent acts of civil disobedience.
