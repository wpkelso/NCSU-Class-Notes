# Geometric Sequence

A geometric [[Sequence|sequence]] is defined when the ratio between successive terms is constant. As such, we get the following definitions for the recursive and closed forms:

>[!note] Definition
>Given the initial term $a_{0}$ and the common ratio $r$,
>- Recursive definition: $a_{n}=ra_{n-1} \;\text{with}\; a_{0}=a$
>- Closed formula: $a_{n}=a(r^{n})$
