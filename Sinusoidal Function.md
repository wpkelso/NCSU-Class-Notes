# Sinusoidal Function
#signal_analysis #mathematics 
Useful in modelling [[Signals|signals]].

**Base form:**
$$
f(t)=Acos(\omega_0t+\theta)=Acos(2\pi f_0t+\theta)
$$
where
$A$ = Amplitude
$\omega_0$ =  Angular frequency in radians/sec
$f_0$ = Frequency in cycles/sec or Hz
$\theta$ = Phase (moves the peak of the cosine to $-\theta/\omega_0$ when in radians, not when in degrees)

Period = $2\pi/\omega_0$ = $1/f_0$

*Sine could also be used, but isn't as $sin(x)=cos(x-\frac{\pi}{2})$*
