# Matrix Multiplication

Matrix multiplication is a binary operation performed on 2 matrices such that $A_{m \times n} \times B_{n \times p} = C_{m \times p}$. As shown, the resultant matrix will have a number of rows $m$ equal to the number of rows in the first matrix, and a number of columns $p$ equal to the number of columns in the second matrix.
