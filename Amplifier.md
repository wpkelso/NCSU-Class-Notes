# Amplifier

An amplifier is a construct that takes some input signal and performs [[Amplification|amplification]] on that input. Broadly, there are 3 classes of amplifiers:

1. Inverting: provide high voltage gain with a $180^{\circ}$ phase shift
	- Common-emitter, common-source configurations
2. Followers: provide nearly [[Unity Gain|unity gain]] similar to the op-amp voltage follower
	- Common-collector, common-drain configurations
3. [[Non-Inverting Amplifiers|Non-inverting]]: provide high voltage gain with no phase shift
	- Common-base, common-gate configurations
