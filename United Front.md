# United Front

An alliance between the [[Guomindang]] and the [[Chinese Communist Party]] in 1923, primarily supported by [[Communist International|Comintern]] through military aid.
This was intended to first bring about a [[Capitalism|Capitalist]] revolution, so that there could then be a [[Communism|communist]] revolution.

## 1926 Northern Expedition

Chiang Kai-shek led a military expedition of the United Front army north from Guangdong, unifying much of China.
Following this, he established a new national government at Nanjing in 1927.
This expedition did not remove all of the [[Warlord Period|warlords]] from China, but removed the vast majority of them.
