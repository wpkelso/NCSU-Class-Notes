> A writing schema meant to improve the logical flow of paragraphs in non-fictional/academic writing.

## Principles

1. Paragraphs are units of ideas
2. Write with different degrees of generalities: General → Specific →  More general
3. Natural voice emerges over time, through the structure of the schema

### Levels of Generality

1. “Very general”
2. “General”
3. “Intentional”
4. “Meh”
5. “Pedantry”

Using these levels, a paragraph should roughly follow a pattern of 4→3→2→1→2→3→4→5 over it’s length, with the final sentence performing the role of the initial sentence of the next paragraph.
