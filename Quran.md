# Quran

The Quran is the holy text of [[Islam]] (like [[The Bible|the Bible]] is to Christianity or the [[Torah]] is to Judaism). However, it is primarily seen as an oral literature confined to text, rather than a textual literature as the other two major holy books are. The original text is in [[Arabic]].
