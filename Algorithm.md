An algorithm describes a sequence of steps to solve a computational problem or perform a calculation. They can be described and implemented in a large amount of ways, be it plain English, psuedocode, directly in a programming language, in hardware, etc.

**Efficient algorithm:** an algorithm whose runtime increase by no more than polynomial time with respect to it's input block.

**NP-complete:** a set of problems for which no known efficient algorithm exists
	All NP-complete problems share common characteristics: No efficient algorithm has been found to solve an NP-complete problem, No one has proven that an efficient algorithm to solve an NP-complete problem is impossible, And if an efficient algorithm exists for one NP-complete problem, then all NP-complete problems can be solved efficiently.

### Algorithms for [[Data Structure]]s
Data structures may share a common set of required algorithms (shifting, insertion, deletion, etc.) the actual implementation of those algorithms will typically be specific to each structure.
