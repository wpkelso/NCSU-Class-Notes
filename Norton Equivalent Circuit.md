# Norton Equivalent Circuit

Like the [[Thevenin's Theorem|Thevenin equivalent circuit]], the Norton equivalent circuit creates a circuit equivalent to a 1-port system using a single current source and a parallel impedance.

## Steps to Obtain with only Independent Sources:

1. Find the short-circuit current between terminals A and B
2. Find the equivalent resistance by replacing all voltage sources in the circuit with shorts and all current sources with an open circuit
3. Redraw the circuit between terminals A-B as the equivalent circuit containing a current source and an equivalent resistor in parallel
