# Complete Set



> [!info] Definition
> A set of sentences $\Gamma$ is complete iff for any sentence $A$, either $A \in \Gamma$ or $\lnot A \in \Gamma$

This definition ensures that for any sentence $A$, it is either “endorsed” or “denied” by $\Gamma$; i.e., either $A$ or $\lnot A$ is contained within $\Gamma$.
