# Member
#OOP #ECE309 

Used in OOP to refer to either a field or function inside of a class. However, conventionally a *member function* or a *member method* will be referred to, instead of just the general concept of the *member* (which will often just be referring to a field).

Access control to members in [[Class]]es is done with the *public* and *private* keywords.
- **Public**: members and methods are accessible to all code
- **Private**: members and methods are only accessible by other member functions within the class.
