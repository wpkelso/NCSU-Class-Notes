# Field Effect Transistor

## JFET (Junction FET)

## MOSFET (Metal Oxide Semiconductor FET)

The MOSFET is one of the most common types of FETs, often acting as an electronically controlled switch. The MOS in MOSFET stands for Metal Oxide [[Semiconductor]], usually using Silicon Oxide as the semiconductor material.

There are a couple different types of MOSFETS:
- n-channel (NMOS)
- p-channel (PMOS)
- Complementary-symmetry (CMOS)
	- This is a combination of n-channel and p-channel devices on the same IC

Additionally, MOSFETS can either be *depletion-type* or *enhancement-type*. NMOS and PMOS devices parallel each other in their characteristics; however, PMOS has itâ€™s polarity reversed with respect to NMOS devices. Thus, all voltages and currents are reversed.

## Operation Regions

### Cutoff

Occurs when $V_{GS} < V_{T}$. In this region, no inversion layer is formed, and drain and source are separated by a depleted channel. This results in $I_{DS} \approx 0$, as well as $i_{B}=i_{G}=0$.

### Linear (Triode/Ohmic)

The Triode region can additionally be considered as the *voltage-controlled resistance* region

### Saturation

### Bias Analysis

1. Assume an operation region (usually saturation)
2. Use circuit analysis to find $V_{GS}$ 
3. Use $V_{GS}$ to calculate $I_{D}$, and $I_{D}$ to calculate $V_{DS}$
4. Check validity of operation region assumptions

### Finding the Q-Point

The [[Quiescent Point]] for a FET is found in a similar way to BJTs, but the Q-Point for a FET is found as ($I_{D}, V_{DS}, V_{GS}$).

### Four-Resistor Bias Network

A four-resistor bias network is used for biasing [[Transistor|transistors]] in discrete circuits, as it stabilizes the bias point with respect to device parameter and temperature variations using negative feedback. Generally, it is used to bias transistors in saturation region.
