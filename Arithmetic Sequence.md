# Arithmetic Sequence

A [[Sequence|sequence]] in which the terms differ by a constant. Thus we can define both the recursive definition and the closed form as follows:

>[!note] Definition
>If the initial term $a_{0}$ of the sequence is $a$ and the common difference is $d$, then we get
>- Recursive definition: $a_{n}=a_{n-1}+d \;\text{with}\; a_{0}=a$
>- Closed formula: $a_{n}=a+dn$
