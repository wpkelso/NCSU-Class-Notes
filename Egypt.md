# Egypt

Located in a hyper-arid environment along the [[Nile River|Nile river]] in [[Africa|Northeast Africa]], Egypt has access to some of the richest agricultural land of the ancient world. As such, Ancient Egypt is one of the five [[River Valley Civilizations]] considered to be the cradles of civilization in the ancient world.

## Ancient Period

In the Ancient period, the Nile river valley had predicable annual flooding that left behind a very rich soil. This allowed the ancient Egyptians to grow up to 2-3 crops on the same soil, making the region extremely agriculturally productive. The region was also protected by many natural barriers, with the deserts of the Sahara/North Africa and [[Arabia]] to the west and east, the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the north, the [[Red Sea]] to it’s east, and the cataracts of the upper Nile to it’s south. This protection meant that for the first 1300 years of it’s civilization, Egypt was never successfully invaded. However, the region lacked timber and metals, requiring the Egyptians to trade for these materials.

### Emergence of Civilization

Around 5000BCE, various [[Neolithic Village|neolithic villages]] existed in the region, eventually coalescing into two rival kingdoms in Upper and Lower Egypt before 3100BCE. Around 3100BCE the two kingdoms were unified under King Menes/Narmer of Upper Egypt, who became the first king of the first dynasty of Egypt. He established his capital at Memphis.

### A United Egypt

After the unification, the periods of Egyptian history can be divided roughly into five periods:

1. [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]]
2. [[First Egyptian Intermediate Period|First Intermediate Period]]
3. [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]]
4. [[Second Egyptian Intermediate Period|Second Intermediate Period]]
5. [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]
