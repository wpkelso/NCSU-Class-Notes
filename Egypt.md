# Egypt

Located in a hyper-arid environment along the [[Nile River|Nile river]] in [[Africa|Northeast Africa]], Egypt has access to some of the richest agricultural land of the ancient world. As such, Ancient Egypt is one of the five [[River Valley Civilizations]] considered to be the cradles of civilization in the ancient world.

## Ancient Period

In the Ancient period, the Nile river valley had predicable annual flooding that left behind a very rich soil. This allowed the ancient Egyptians to grow up to 2-3 crops on the same soil, making the region extremely agriculturally productive.
