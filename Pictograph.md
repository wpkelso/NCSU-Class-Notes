# Pictograph

Marks in a system of writing that are based on the resemblance they have to what they represent. Within this system, there are two further classifications:

1. **Ideograms:** resemble concepts
2. **Logograms:** represent whole words

>[!example] 
> The Chinese system of writing is a pictographic writing system, with each Hanzi representing a concept similar to what it looked like.
