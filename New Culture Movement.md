# New Culture Movement

From 1915 to 1919, the “New Culture Movement” started, beginning with the “New Youth,” intended to found a new ideology to replace [[Confucianism]].

## New Youth

One of the foremost efforts of the “New Youth” was in language reform; they wanted literature to be in plain, spoken language (_baihua_) rather than in Classical Chinese.
As Mandarin was the most widely spoken language in China at the time, Mandarin was what this “colloquial” language was based on.

## May 4 Movement

At the end of [[World War I]], the Chinese government in Beijing sent a delegate to the Paris Peace Conference to present demands on the “Shandong Issue.”
Specifically, Japan had taken over the former German sphere of influence in Shandong province in northern China.
The peace conference rejected Chinese demands.

Following this rejection, the May 4 movement begins with large student demonstrations in Beijing.
