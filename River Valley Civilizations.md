# River Valley Civilizations

Primarily agrarian civilizations that grew up around the banks of a major river, mostly around the end of the [[Neolithic]] and beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in Africa and Asia. The river gave the inhabitants a reliable source of drinking water in addition to fertile land with which to grow crops, allowing civilizations to begin and flourish.

## The Cradles of Civilization
Generally, the four major river valley civilizations that constitute the "Cradles of Civilization" consist of the [[Indus River Valley Civilization]], [[Sumeria]], [[Ancient Egypt]], and [[China]].
