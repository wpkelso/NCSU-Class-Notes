# Unified Extensible Firmware Interface

>[!summary] 
> 

Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, or UEFI for short, is a specification developed to replace [[Basic Input Output System|BIOS]] as the architecture defining platform firmware and itâ€™s interface for interacting with the [[Operating System|operating system]].

The UEFI Forum was established in 2005, following the release of the last specification of EFI (an in-between stage developed by Intel), which was subsequently donated as a contribution to the UEFI Forum.
