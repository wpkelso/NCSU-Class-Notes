# Software Development Method

1. Requirements Specification:
    - State the problem and gain a clear understanding of what is required for it’s solution
    - Study the problem carefully, eliminating aspects that are unimportant and zero in on the root problem
    - If the problem is not completely defined, request more information form the person posing the problem (which can be yourself)
2. Analysis
    - Identify the problem’s inputs, desired outputs, and any additional requirements or constraints on the solution
    - Determine the required form and units in which the results should be displayed
3. Design
    - Develop an [[Algorithm|algorithm]] to solve the problem
    - Verify the algorithm solves the problem as intended
4. Implementation
    - Implement the algorithm as a program in a language either best suited for solving the problem, or as specified by the requirements
5. Verification and Testing
    - Test the completed program and verify that it works as expected
    - Use multiple sets of data, rather than relying on a single test case
