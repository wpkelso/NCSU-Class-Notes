Ordering [[Instruction Set Architecture|instructions]] in a program in such a way so as to decrease the total run time of the program and allow the [[Computer Processor|processor]] to be more simply and easily designed. Optimal scheduling is [[Algorithm|NP-Complete]], so a [[Heuristic|heuristic]] approach is used instead.

## Scheduling Methodologies
- [[Cycle Scheduling]] (Most common approach)
- [[Iterative Modulo Scheduling]]
