# Linear Regression
#machine_learning 
### Terminology
- Training Data
- Test Data
- Learned Model

### Goal
Given a set of training data, compute a learned model such that it can generate accurate predicted outcomes from a set of test data who was not taken into account during the production of the model ([[Mean Squared Error]])

**Key Assumption**: *test data has not been seen before within the training stage, otherwise there will be overfitting*

### Linear Models
Essentially taking one set of input-outputs pairs and assigning a line-of-best-fit, then predicting outcomes based upon that

Generally:
**y**$=$**x**$\beta$+**e**
