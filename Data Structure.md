**Definition:** a way of organizing, storing, and performing operations on data.

### Basic Data Structures:
- [[Record]]
- [[Array]]
- [[Linked List]]

Choosing which data structure a given program should use is based on the structure of the expected data and the operations that might need to be performed on that data.
