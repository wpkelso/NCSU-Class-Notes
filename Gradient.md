>The gradient of a [[Scalar|scalar]]-valued differentiable function of several variables is the [[Vector Field|vector field]] $\nabla f$ whose value at point $p$ is the "direction and rate of fastest increase."

The gradient plays a fundamental role in [[Optimization Theory|optimization theory]], and is useful in such fields as [[Machine Learning|machine learning]].
