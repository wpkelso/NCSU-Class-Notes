# Recurrence

A [[Formula|formula]] or [[Sequence|sequence]] that is defined using previous elements of the sequence. Perhaps one of the most famous examples of a recurrence is the [[Fibonacci Series]] which is defined using the previous two elements of the sequence.

Given this, the recursive definition of a sequence consists of a recurrence relation and an initial condition.

## Closed Form

The closed form of a recurrence is a [[Function|function]] that is defined to enable solving for some arbitrary element $g_{n}$ without solving for $g_{n-1}, g_{n-2}, \dots, g_{0}$. It entails using a fixed-amount of finite operations on $n$.
