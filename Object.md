# Object

In programming--specifically in [[Object Oriented Programming|object oriented programming]]--an object is considered to be a specific instance of a [[Class]]. This means that opposed to the definition of a class, where all of the components that make up the class are defined, an object actually occupies memory and can be operated on. 

>[!note] 
>Instantiation is not unique to classes and objects, as you can also have an instance of a [[Variable|variable]] or some other structure. As such, objects refer *specifically* to the instances of classes and their [[Member|members]] (which are also considered to be objects; i.e. the member of an object is also an object)
