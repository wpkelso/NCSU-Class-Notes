In [[Korean Language|Korean]], the final consonant in a syllable is never released. The speaker will put their mouth into the position for the consonant, but will then tense and relax the mouth without producing any sound. This means that the full pronunciation and complexity of the consonant is lost. It should be noted that this pronunciation is not lost in cases where [[Re-Syllabification|re-syllabification]] can be applied.
