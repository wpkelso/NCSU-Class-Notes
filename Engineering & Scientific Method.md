# Engineering & Scientific Method

1. Recognize and understand the problem
    - Study the problem carefully, eliminating aspects that are unimportant and zeroing in on the root problem
2. Accumulate facts
    - Figure out all pertinent physical facts, such as sizes, temperatures, voltages, weights, and costs
3. Select the appropriate theory or principle
    - Select appropriate theories or scientific principles that apply to the problem solution
    - Understand and identify limits or constraints that apply
4. Make necessary assumptions
    - Simplify the problem in order to solve it; perfect solutions to many real problems do not exist
    - Be sure simplifications do not significantly affect the accuracy of the solution
5. Solve the problem
6. Verify and check results
