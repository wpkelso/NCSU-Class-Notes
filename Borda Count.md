# Borda Count

A family of [[Positional Voting|positional voting]] rules in which for each ballot, a candidate gets a number of points corresponding to the number of candidates ranked below them. Given that it is intended to elect a broadly acceptable option, rather than simply the preference of the majority, the Borda count is considered a consensus-based voting system.
