Culture first discovered in caves on Mount Carmel in Israel, the Natufians were a culture believed to have existed between 9500 BCE and 8000 BCE (at the end of the [[Pleistocene|last ice age]] in the [[Paleolithic]] and the start of the [[Neolithic]]). They harvested wild grains and kept wild goats in pens until they were ready to eat them.
