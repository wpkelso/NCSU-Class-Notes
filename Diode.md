# Diode
Constructed by depositing a p-type [[Semiconductor|semiconductor]] on top of an n-type semiconductor.

>[!note] Definition
> A **PN Junction** is the interfacing region between the $n$ and $p$ regions inside of a diode or other semiconductor-based component.

In a diode, the $p$ region is on the anode/positive side of the diode, and the $n$ region is on the cathode/negative side of the diode.

## Biasing

There are three types of biasing, or operating regions in diodes: equilibrium, reverse bias, and forward bias.

### Equilibrium (No Bias)

At zero bias, and $t=0$
